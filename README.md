## Hello! 👋

I'm Abhinav Vedmala, a student at the University of Maryland 🐢, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

Outside of class, I'm currently:
- 👨🏽‍💻 interning as a software engineer at Capital One's Tech Incubator
- ☕️ leading discussions sections as a teaching assistant for CMSC 132 (Object-Oriented Programming)- 
- 🛰 conducting research as an undergrad assistant with the Stereo Winds Lab at NASA Goddard

I'm most interested in back-end development and algorithms. These are the most satisfying problems for me to solve and I want to gain more depth in these areas as well as breadth in other areas.
